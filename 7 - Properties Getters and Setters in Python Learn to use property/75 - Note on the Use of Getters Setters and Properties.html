<h4><strong>1️⃣ They are Not Always Necessary</strong></h4><p>It is important to note that you do not necessarily have to add getters and setters for all your protected attributes. The decision of whether or not to include a getter and/or a setter should be taken after a careful analysis. </p><p>If the attribute is only intended to be used and updated within the class, and you cannot foresee any possible scenarios where you might need to access or update an attribute outside of the class, you can omit them.</p><h4><strong>2️⃣ You Can Create Read-Only Properties</strong></h4><p>Sometimes an attribute only has to be set when the instance is created and then it is updated automatically using methods that are defined within the class. In this case, you can define read-only properties by only adding a getter (only using @property). </p>
