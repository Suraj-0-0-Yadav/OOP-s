<p>ðŸ“Œ <strong>An important tip </strong>is that before we start writing a program using Object-Oriented Programming, we need to analyze what objects will be needed, their attributes, methods, and interactions. </p><p>An example of this would be the Tic-Tac-Toe project that we just created. Based on the description of the game, we knew that we needed to define a <code>Player</code> class and a <code>Board</code> class and after careful analysis, we decided to include a <code>Move</code> class.</p><p>But how can we analyze the problem description? </p><p>This is the goal of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.</p><p>Its four main goals are to...</p><ul><li><p>Identify Classes.</p></li><li><p>Identify Attributes.</p></li><li><p>Identify Methods.</p></li><li><p>Identify relationships and interactions between the objects of the classes.</p></li></ul><p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Guidelines</strong></p><ul><li><p>We can identify potential classes from the <strong>nouns </strong>in a problem description.</p></li><li><p>We can identify potential attributes from the <strong>adjectives </strong>(and <strong>nouns</strong>) in a problem description.</p></li><li><p>We can identify potential methods from the <strong>verbs </strong>that describe actions that the objects can take in the program. </p></li></ul><p>After this initial analysis where we write all possible classes, attributes, and methods that we might need to include, we perform a deeper analysis to determine which ones will be relevant for our program and how the objects will interact with each other. This is how we create the final structure of our program.</p><p>ðŸ”¸ <strong>PDF Handout</strong></p><p>You are welcome to download the PDF resource for this lecture below: "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design - Handout".</p>
