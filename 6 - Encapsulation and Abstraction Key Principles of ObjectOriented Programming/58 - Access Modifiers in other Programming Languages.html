<p>In other programming languages, you can control the "visibility" of an attribute or method of a class using what we call <strong>access modifiers</strong>, special keywords that come with the language.</p><p>For example, <strong>Java</strong> has three access modifiers:</p><ul><li><p><code>public</code> - it has the widest scope. The element can be accessed anywhere in the program. </p></li></ul><p>Example:&nbsp;<code>public int a = 5;</code></p><ul><li><p><code>protected</code> - the element is accessible within the same package (you can think of a package as a "folder") or within subclasses in different packages.</p></li></ul><p>Example: <code>protected int a = 5;</code> </p><ul><li><p><code>private</code> - the element is only accessible within the same class.</p></li></ul><p>Example: <code>private int a = 5;</code> </p><p>Java also has a default access when no keyword is used. In this case, the element is accessible within the same package.</p><p>There can be different access modifiers depending on the programming language.
